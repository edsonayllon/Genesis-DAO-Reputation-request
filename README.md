## Fullstack Blockchain Developer [Ethereum, EOS], Venture Capitalist

Hi Genesis DAO. 

My name is Edson Ayllon, founder of The Pennsylvania State University's Blockchain Club, Former Lead Developer and Managing Partner of [Azure Black](https://azureblack.com/), and current Fullstack Developer for DeFi related projects. Recently, I've had brief encounters from the team at Block One which manages EOS, and members of the Ethereum Foundation working on the next version of Ethereum. 

I would like to participate in the Genesis DAO, namely to integrate Bounties Network actions to the DAOstack's Alchemy.
